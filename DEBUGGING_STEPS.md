# GitHub Pages Styling Issue - Debugging Steps

## Problem
Filter panel appears full-width and pushes content down on GitHub Pages, but works correctly locally.

## Files Verified
- All HTML, CSS, and JS files are **identical** between local and deployed versions
- CSS file (styles.css): 19,543 bytes - ✅ MATCHES
- HTML file (index.html): 10,859 bytes - ✅ MATCHES
- JavaScript modules: All loading with correct MIME types - ✅ OK

## Root Cause
The deployed files are correct. The issue is likely:
1. **Browser cache** storing an old version
2. **CSS not loading** due to network/CDN issue
3. **JavaScript error** preventing initialization

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Force Cache Clear
Open GitHub Pages in **Incognito/Private Mode**:
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+N (Win) or Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)
- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Win) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac)
- Safari: Cmd+Shift+N (Mac)

### Step 2: Hard Refresh
If still broken, do a hard refresh:
- Chrome/Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+R (Win) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Safari: Cmd+Option+R

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab for errors:
- Look for red error messages
- Check if CSS file loads: Network tab → Filter by CSS → Look for styles.css (should be 200 OK)
- Check if JS modules load: Network tab → Filter by JS

### Step 4: Verify CSS Loaded
In Developer Tools Console, type:
```javascript
getComputedStyle(document.getElementById('filter-panel')).position
```

Expected result: `"fixed"`
If it returns `"static"` or `"relative"`, CSS didn't load properly.

### Step 5: Check for JavaScript Errors
In Console, type:
```javascript
document.querySelector('.filter-panel')
```

Should return the DOM element. If null, something's wrong with HTML.

Then check:
```javascript
getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('.filter-panel')).right
```

Should return: `"-420px"` (hidden off-screen)

## Quick Diagnosis

**If CSS didn't load:**
- Filter panel will be visible as a block element (no `position: fixed`)
- Layout will be broken (no flexbox styling)
- Colors will be default (black text, white background, no shadows)

**If JavaScript didn't load:**
- Filter checkboxes will be empty (not populated dynamically)
- "Filtros" button won't work
- Chart area will be empty

**If cache issue:**
- Hard refresh will fix it immediately

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
1. Filter panel is **hidden off-screen** (right: -420px)
2. Only visible when "Filtros" button is clicked
3. Slides in from right with transition animation
4. Has dark overlay behind it when open

## Manual Test

After opening page in incognito mode:
1. Page should load with chart area on left
2. "Filtros" button visible in top-right of chart header
3. Filter panel should be **hidden** (not visible)
4. Click "Filtros" button → panel should slide in from right
5. Click X or overlay → panel should slide out to right

If all these work, the issue was browser cache.
